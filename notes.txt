"axios": "^0.27.2", -> I'm using axios for making http calls
"react-redux": "^8.0.2", -> I'm using react-redux for global state managing
"react-responsive-carousel": "^3.2.23", -> I'm using react-responsive-carousel for carousel view

Known Issues:
    - I think my implementation of filtering matches is not the best, but I was not able to make it more cleaner because I had some issues with finding out
    response.data which was returned from endpoint. 

    -I would prefer to use NextJS react framework because of: server-side rendering (SSR), API routes, Image/Link components, router...
    -I would prefer to use Tailwindcss for faster developing responsive design
