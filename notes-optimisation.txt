In this case I have used React Redux for global state. I am calling http GET method on your API in useEffect function in App.tsx, 
then saving response data to global state. I'm using useSelector hook to read data from Redux Store in every MatchCarousel with this approach I'm not 
calling endpoint for every carousel itself.

Note: in DEV environment useEffect is triggering twice because of React-strict-mode if we build our project call is made only once
